// Link
// The LINK type defines a logical relationship between two items, such as two ENTRYs or an ENTRY and
// a COMPOSITION. Links can be used across compositions, and across EHRs. Links can potentially be used
// between interior (i.e. non archetype root) nodes, although this probably should be prevented in
// archetypes. Multiple LINKs can be attached to the root object of any archetyped structure to give
// the effect of a 1â†’N link.
