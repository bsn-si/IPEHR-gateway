| :heavy_check_mark:    | Testing Guide | [Readme.md](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/README.md#how-to) | The "How To" guide is supplemented with all new features developed in this milestone |
| 1. :heavy_check_mark: | Research of available blockchains supporting EVM-based smart contracts | See [IPEHR smart contract](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-blockchain-indexes) page | The test contract is deployed to the Goerli testnet. For the contract fork to the FVM network a golang client is needed to correctly interact with FEVM JSON-RPC API. | 
| 2. :heavy_check_mark: | Development of the user account catalogue and the user identification mechanism | See [Users_identity](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone_3/2_Users_identity.md) page | Users and user groups are stored in the [IPEHR smart contract](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-blockchain-indexes). The authorization of requests to the IPEHR gateway API is done via the JWT token. | 
| 3. :heavy_check_mark: | Embedding access rights management | See [Docs_access_management](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone_3/3_Docs_access_mgmt.md) page | Documents can be grouped by arbitrary criteria. From medical classification to geographical location. Access to documents is managed according to a particular access matrix. |
| 4. :heavy_check_mark: | Design and development of the access keys storage | See [Access_store](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone_3/4_Access_store.md) page | Access Key Storage is a hash table that is located in the smart contract. The key of the table is a special 32 byte identification number. |
| 5. :heavy_check_mark: | Design and development of a smart contract API | See [Iface](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone_3/5_Iface_to_contract.md) | To interact with a smart contract containing a repository of users, documents and access rights, the indexer package was developed using the Go Ethereum library. To prevent the execution of repeated transactions, the nonce mechanism is used in combination with ECDSA signature verification. |

# Workflow example

The following methods are based on the [standard specification of OpenEHR](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/Release-1.0.2/ehr.html)

<img width="800" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15906120/192385584-0d50ac5b-ae3c-40f2-bce5-8a0ab3a8da1f.png">

P.S. For creating a UUID you can use a generator (e.g [uuidgenerator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version1))

## How to create and work with a user
`Disclaimer: you have to register a user and must log in under your credentials before doing any actions. We recommend saving all essential information such as userID, tokens, EhrSystem, and the other data in a separate file for easy access to copy-paste it`

### How to register a user
Precondition: Open [swagger](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html)
1. Choose [Register user](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html#/USER/post_user_register) method and click **Try it out**
1. Fill in **EhrSystemId** (any system name or UUID format). In **Request** form put your userID (e.g user1), password and click **Execute**

**Result**: you see that the user is successfully created. You can use your userID and password to log in

### How to login under the user
Precondition: Open [swagger](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html) and [register](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/wiki/IPEHR-project#how-to-register-a-user) under registered user OR use exciting user
1. Choose [Login user](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html#/USER/post_user_login) method and click **Try it out**
1. Fill in **AuthUserId** (userID that you got before), **EhrSystemId** (that you put when register). In **Request** form put your userID and password that you registered before and click **Execute**

**Result**: you've got access and a refresh token which can be used instead password for future actions

[Watch video instruction](https://media.bsn.si/ipehr/v2/login.mp4) ðŸ“¹ 

### How to refresh JWT token
Precondition: Open [swagger](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html) and [login](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html#/USER/post_user_login) under registered user
1. Choose [Refresh JWT](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html#/USER/get_user_refresh_) method and click **Try it out**
1. Fill in **AuthUserId** (it is your REFRESH token in the format "Bearer XXX" where XXX is your refresh token), **AuthUserId** (that you are logged in) and **EhrSystemId**, click **Execute**

**Result**: your access and refresh tokens are updated. If you failed it means that you were logged out, try to log in again.

## How to create EHR

### Create a general EHR
Precondition: Open [swagger](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html) and [login](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/wiki/IPEHR-project#hou-to-login-under-the-user) under registered user
1. Choose [Create EHR](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html#/EHR/post_ehr) method and click **Try it out**
1. Fill in **Authorization** (you Bearer and access token), **AuthUserId** (your userID), **EhrSystemId** (any system name or UUID) and **Prefer** (return=representation) and click **Execute**

**Result**: While the request is running, the document is saved to IPFS, the indexes and meta-information about the document are written to a smart contract on the blockchain, and a deal is started to store the document in Filecoin.
You will get a **requestid** in the **response header**, which can be used to get more information about the request's status.

1. Copy the **CID** value from the **EhrCreate** section 
1. Check if the file is available on the IPFS network using the link [ipfs.io/ipfs/XXX](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/) where **XXX** is your **CID** value

**Result**: The document will be downloaded to your computer, but you will not be able to read the content because it is encrypted
