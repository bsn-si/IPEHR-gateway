## Workflow example

We have integrated the ipEHR gateway with the Better Studio HMS playground to pass EHR documents from the HMS to the FIL network.

## The test case:
### Preconditions:

-   A Patient is registered (swagger POST /user/register)
-   A Doctor is registered (swagger POST /user/register)

### Main flow:

-   An HMS admin creates a patient in the HMS with users's ipEHR `UserID`;
-   The user's EHR is autmatically created by the HMS in th—É blockchain;
-   A doctor creates a new health record (blood pressure) in the HMS;
-   The created record is found in the blockchain with added blood pressure values;
-   We use Swagger to check blockchain operations;

Here is the demonstration video:
