| 1. :heavy_check_mark: | Integrate Filecoin as a storage for MH-ORM database | See [Filecoin_storage](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone_2/1_Filecoin_integration.md) page | At IPEHR we use a two-tiered document storage system: 1. The IPFS distributed file system for quick access. 2. The Filecoin storage network for long-term guaranteed storage of EHR documents. Filecoin storage deals are made for a fixed period of time. Usually from 180 days. As the deadline approaches, the deal must be extended. This functionality will be added in the next phases. | 
| 2. :heavy_check_mark: | Integrate a storage for MH-ORM indexes | See [Indexes_storage](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone_2/2_Indexes_storage.md) page | An EVM smart contract has been developed to store EHR document indexes. | 
| 3. :heavy_check_mark: | An algorithm of data re-encryption while changing access rights | See [Revoking_access](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone_2/3_Revoking_access.md) page | To grant access to a document, the document access key is asymmetrically encrypted with the public key of the user (or group) being granted access and added to the IPEHR smart contract table. To revoke access to a document, a user with the rights of the document owner just deletes the appropriate record in the table. |
| 4. :heavy_check_mark: | Records chains | See [Chains of records](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone_2/4_Chains_of_records.md) page | When a new EHR document is added, the digital signature of the user creating the document is sent along with the document. The signature is stored with the document. This allows you to authorize a request to create a document. |
| 5. :heavy_check_mark: | Performance tests and optimisation | See [Workflow examples](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone2_delivery.md#workflow-example) | Milestone deliverables testing examples with video guides | 
| 6. :heavy_check_mark: | Payment logic | See [payment logic](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/blob/develop/progress/Milestone_2/6_Payment_logic.md) | when working with the IPEHR system, payment for transactions is made from the organization's account within the available balance |

# Workflow example

The following methods are based on the [standard specification of OpenEHR](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/Release-1.0.2/ehr.html)

<img width="800" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15906120/192385584-0d50ac5b-ae3c-40f2-bce5-8a0ab3a8da1f.png">

P.S. For creating a UUID you can use a generator (e.g [uuidgenerator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version1))

## How to create EHR

### Create a general EHR
Precondition: Open [swagger](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html)
1. Choose [Create EHR](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html#/EHR/post_ehr) method and click **Try it out**
1. Fill in **AuthUserId** (UUID format e.g 46f3df9f-817c-4910-825f-92d5ea595c73), **EhrSystemId** (any system name or UUID) and **Prefer** (return=representation) and click **Execute**

**Result**: While the request is running, the document is saved to IPFS, the indexes and meta-information about the document are written to a smart contract on the blockchain, and a deal is started to store the document in Filecoin.
You will get a **requestid** in the **response header**, which can be used to get more information about the status of the request.

#### Check if the file is available on the IPFS network
Precondition: Execute [Create EHR](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/wiki/IPEHR-project#create-a-general-ehr) and [Get created EHR by ID](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/wiki/IPEHR-project#get-created-ehr-by-request-id) steps
1. Copy the **CID** value from the **EhrCreate** section 
1. Check if the file is available on the IPFS network using the link [ipfs.io/ipfs/XXX](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/) where **XXX** is your **CID** value

**Result**: The document will be downloaded to your computer, but you will not be able to read the content because it is encrypted

#### Check if the execution of the transaction is available on the goerli.etherscan.io
Precondition: Execute [Create EHR](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/wiki/IPEHR-project#create-a-general-ehr) and [Get created EHR by ID](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/wiki/IPEHR-project#get-created-ehr-by-id) steps
1. Copy the **hash** of a transaction in sections such as **SetEhrDocs** or **SetDocAccess**
1. Check the execution of the transaction using the [goerli.etherscan.io](https://goerli.etherscan.io) explorer

**Result**: You see the execution of the transaction

[Watch video instruction](https://media.bsn.si/ipehr/v2/check_goerli.mp4) ðŸ“¹ 

#### Check Filecoin document storage transaction is complete
Precondition: Execute [Create EHR](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/wiki/IPEHR-project#create-a-general-ehr) and [Get created EHR by ID](https://github.com/bsn-si/IPEHR-gateway/wiki/IPEHR-project#get-created-ehr-by-id) steps. Wait until **FilecoinStartDeal** status change from 'Pending' to 'Success' (usually takes about 24 hours)
1. Copy the **dealId**
1. Go to [filfox.info/en/deal/XXX](https://filfox.info/en/deal/) and paste to the search your dealId instead of XXX

**Result**: You see file and data stored on filecoin

### Create EHR with EHR_ID
1. Choose [Create EHR with id](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html#/EHR/put_ehr__ehr_id_) method and click **Try it out**
1. Fill in **AuthUserId** (UUID format e.g 46f3df9f-817c-4910-825f-92d5ea595c73), **EhrSystemId** (any system name or UUID), **Prefer** (return=representation) and **ehr_id** (UUID as a user-specified EHR identifier) and click **Execute**

**Result**: in the response, you see a created EHR with structured data in JSON format and exact ehr_id that you put before

[Watch video instruction](https://media.bsn.si/ipehr/v2/create_ehr_with_id.mp4) ðŸ“¹

### Create EHR with different parameters, such as subject id and id namespace
1. Choose [PUT Create EHR](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html#/EHR/post_ehr) method click **Try it out**
1. Fill in **AuthUserId** (UUID format e.g 46f3df9f-817c-4910-825f-92d5ea595c73) and specify **ehr_id** (also UUID format)
1. Change params in the Request field:
** "subject" -> "external_ref" -> "id" -> "value" -> put here id (e.g num123)
** "subject" -> "external_ref" -> "id" -> "namespace" -> put here namespace (e.g testnamespace)
1. Click **Execute**

**Result**: You see a created EHR with structured data in JSON format in the response. There are no subject_id and subject_space fields, they can be only requested with GET request

## How to get EHR with different parameters

### Get created EHR by request id

1. Choose [Get request by ID](https://gateway.ipehr.org/swagger/index.html#/REQUEST/get_requests__request_id_) method
1. Paste **AuthUserId** and **request_id** values and click **Execute**

**Result**: In the response, you will get additional information about the progress of this request, including the transaction hashes in the blockchain, the file cid in IPFS, and the dealCid - the transaction id in Filecoin
